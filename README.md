Ping-loger This utility helps to control delays and connections to something while saving the result in txt. There are several flags in the program -a this flag is responsible for the connection address. The -d flag is responsible for the delay limit. If no flags are entered, the default parameters address "google.com" and delay 40 ms will be used.
